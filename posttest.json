        "a": "mg/L⁻¹",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect unit format.",
        "b": "Correct. COD is expressed as milligrams per liter of oxygen (mg/L O₂).",
        "c": "Too generic, not a standard unit for COD.",
        "d": "mg alone is not volume-normalized."

      "question": "In COD, the quantity of oxidant consumed is expressed in terms of its",
      "answers": {
        "a": "None of the above",
        "b": "Oxygen equivalence",
        "c": "Dissolved oxygen equivalence",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. There is a specific equivalence.",
        "b": "Correct. COD measures oxidant demand in terms of oxygen equivalence.",
        "c": "Close, but not the standard terminology.",
        "d": "Carbon equivalence is not used for COD."

        "a": "Weak acids do not ensure complete reaction with alkalinity.",
        "b": "Bases are not used to determine alkalinity.",
