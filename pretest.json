      "question": "The hardness of a water sample is usually a measure of",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Ca²⁺ and OH⁻",
        "b": "Na²⁺ and Mg²⁺",
        "c": "Na²⁺ and Cl⁻",
        "d": "Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "OH⁻ does not contribute to hardness.",
        "b": "Na²⁺ is not typically involved in hardness.",
        "c": "Na⁺ and Cl⁻ are not responsible for water hardness.",
        "d": "Correct. Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ ions are responsible for water hardness."

      "question": "If the methyl orange alkalinity of the water equals or exceeds the total hardness, all the hardness is present as",
      "answers": {
        "a": "None of the above",
        "b": "Bicarbonate hardness",
        "c": "Hydroxide hardness",
        "d": "Carbonate hardness"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This scenario corresponds to a specific type of hardness.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Bicarbonate hardness is temporary hardness.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Hydroxide ions are not dominant here.",
        "d": "Correct. When methyl orange alkalinity equals or exceeds total hardness, all hardness is carbonate."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect unit format.",
        "b": "Correct. COD is expressed as milligrams per liter of oxygen (mg/L O₂).",

        "a": "Incorrect. There is a specific equivalence.",
        "b": "Correct. COD measures oxidant demand in terms of oxygen equivalence.",
